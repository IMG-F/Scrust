**Scrust** is a compiled language for Scratch 3.0 projects. It brings modern programming features like functions, typed variables, and structured control flow to Scratch, compiling down to `.sb3` files.

> ⚠️ **ALPHA WARNING** ⚠️
> 
> This project is currently in **early alpha**. 
> - The syntax, API, and features are subject to breaking changes at any time.
> - It is **not stable** and should not be used for critical production projects.
> - Bugs and incomplete features are expected.

## Features

- **Modern Syntax**: Rust-inspired syntax with functions, typed variables, and blocks.
- **Compilation**: Compiles directly to standard `.sb3` Scratch project files.
- **Project Management**: CLI tools to create, build, and manage projects.
- **Asset Management**: Easily handle sprites, costumes, and sounds.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**: You need to have Rust installed (latest stable version recommended).
- **Git**: To clone the repository.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DilemmaGX/Scrust.git
cd Scrust
```

### Usage

#### 1. Create a New Project

Use the `create` command to generate a new project structure:

```sh
cargo run -- create my_project
```

This will create a directory `my_project` with a default `Scrust.toml` and source files.

#### 2. Build the Project

Navigate to your project directory and build it:

```sh
cd my_project
cargo run --manifest-path ../Cargo.toml -- build
```
*(Note: If you installed Scrust globally or added it to path, you would just run `scrust build`)*

The compiled project will be in `dist/project.sb3`. You can load this file into the Scratch editor.
